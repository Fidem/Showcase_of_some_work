# Oli's "Portfolio"
This is a brief collection of work that I have done through University and hobby projects.  I am going to keep adding to this when I can, so one day when I am a data science expert I can look back and see my humble beginnings.

Contents:
 - Double Pendulum Code and Report (Penultimate year physics project)/n
 - ADSB Report (Final year Physics project)
 - Neural Network Python code showing my initial steps to learning how to get computers to learn.
